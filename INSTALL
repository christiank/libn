== Installing libn ==

libn itself is very small, easy to compile and written in portable C.
However, it depends on mruby, but not too many operating systems maintain
packages for it. That means you're going to have to build everything in
place.


== 1. Fetch and install mruby ==

Get mruby-1.0.0 at http://mruby.org and build it. No need to install it, but
note the static library in build/host/lib/libmruby.a.


== 2. Install libn ==

This is really easy. Type "make". It should generate a static library called
"libn.a."
