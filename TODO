== libn TODO list ==

- To what extent is libn responsible for making *objects* with *methods* and
  *properties* and all that fun stuff?

- To what extent does libn advocate Rubyisms?

- A Makefile that doesn't require BSD make(1) would be cool.

- Man pages for EVERYTHING -- use ronn for that?? Or just mandoc?

- Should (nstringhash)'s keys be internally kept as Symbols? Does that save
  memory?

- How to actually free the memory of (mrb_value)s we create *besides* just
  freeing the (mrb_state) itself?
